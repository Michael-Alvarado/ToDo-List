/* Configure password authentication strategy.
 *
 * The `LocalStrategy` authenticates users by verifying a username and password.
 * The strategy parses the username and password from the request and calls the
 * `verify` function.
 *
 * The `verify` function queries the database for the user record and verifies
 * the password by hashing the password supplied by the user and comparing it to
 * the hashed password stored in the database.  If the comparison succeeds, the
 * user is authenticated; otherwise, not.
 */

/* Configure session management.
 *
 * When a login session is established, information about the user will be
 * stored in the session.  This information is supplied by the `serializeUser`
 * function, which is yielding the user ID and username.
 *
 * As the user interacts with the app, subsequent requests will be authenticated
 * by verifying the session.  The same user information that was serialized at
 * session establishment will be restored when the session is authenticated by
 * the `deserializeUser` function.
 *
 * Since every request to the app needs the user ID and username, in order to
 * fetch todo records and render the user element in the navigation bar, that
 * information is stored in the session.
